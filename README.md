## Mean function: wmhs_method.m

Usage: Out = wmhs_method(Mask_WMH,Mask_WM,Dmap_Vent,Dmap_Cort,Method)

> Subdivide white matter hyperintensities (WMH) into Periventricular WMHs (PVWMHs), Deep WMHs (DWMHs), and (optional) Juxtaventricular WMHs (JVWMHs).
> 
> Usage: Out = wmhs_method(Mask_WMH,Mask_WM,Dmap_Vent,Dmap_Cort,Method)
>
> Inputs:
> Mask_WMH - binary mask of total WMHs.
> Mask_WM - birnary mask of total white matter.
> Dmap_Vent -  distance map to lateral ventricles.
> Dmap_Cort - distance map to cortex.
> Method -  Subdivision methods, must be one of following options:
>   "DM10" - Classic Dilation Mask (DM10) method classifies WMH voxels less than 10mm to ventricle walls as PVWMHs, and the rest as DWMHs.
>   "DM313" - Modified Dilation Mask (DM313) method classifies WMH voxels less than 3mm to ventricle walls as JVWMHs, between 3mm-13mm as PVWMHs, and the rest as DWMHs.
>   "CC" - Connected Component (CC) method classifies continued WMH clusters touching ventricle walls as PVWMHs, and the rest as DWMHs.
>   "BD" - Bilateral Distance (BD) method computes a WMH voxelâ€™s closest distances to ventricle and to crebral cortex, 
>          and classifies the voxel as PVWMH if it is closer to ventricle than to cortex, otherwise as DWMH.
>
> Output:
> Out - mask of WMHs subdivisions, of same dimension as M.
>   Label values: 0 - Background; 1 - DWMHs; 2 - PVWMHs; 3 - JVWMHs (for "DM313" method only).
>
> Requirements:
>   Dimension must be same for all inputs masks and distance maps.
>   Matlab Image Processing Toolbox must be installed for "CC" subdivision method.
